                        Making a reservation with the wrong date is one of the most common mistakes that come from the distraction of the bookers. This will cause you any inconvenience or make you get troubles such as:
                        
                        The room type which you prefer was fully booked but not available
                        You have to pay the extra fee to amend the booking. The extra fee will depend on each hotel’s policy.
                        It might take a lot of time to contact and fix the issue with the hotel.

    It has been several months since I landed in Indonesia. It is a great nation with a diverse culture and marvelous nature. I have had the chance to meet dozens of people and visit several regions across the country. It was a unique experience because I aimed to visit Indonesia as a student in Malaysia several years back.
    
    Unfortunately, I could not visit Indonesia at that time. Fortunately</h3>
